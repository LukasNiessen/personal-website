# From Idea to Offering: How Consultants Turn Trends into Value

When clients ask what "making an offering" actually means, I usually say: it's about turning hype into something useful, structured, and sellable. A good offering isn't just tech — it's painpoints, value, packaging, and scaling.

## How to Build an Offering

I keep it simple and structured:

**Start with painpoints & ICPs** → Who's hurting, and why?

**Size the opportunity** → TAM/SAM/SOM to check if it's worth the effort.

**Pick 2–3 use cases** → High impact + doable.

**Design a reference architecture & packages** → Typically a 3-step model (Discover / MVP / Pilot).

**Define pricing, KPIs & risks** → What success looks like, and what to watch out for.

**Test with a lighthouse client** → Fast feedback before scaling.

Once it works, sales enablement, playbooks, and partner co-sell make sure it grows.

## Example: GenAI Contact Center Accelerator

**Problem:** long handling times, inconsistent answers, high training costs.

**Solution:** a RAG-based assistant with policy guardrails, analytics, and channel integration.

**Architecture:** Connector → ETL/Chunking → Vector DB → LLM Gateway (policies/evals) → Channels → Observability.

**Value:**
- –15–30% AHT
- +10–15 CSAT points
- Fewer escalations, faster ramp-up

**Differentiation:** compliance-ready (EU AI Act, GDPR), pre-built evals, industry playbooks.

**Controls:** guardrails, offline evals, caching.

**KPIs:** AHT, FCR, CSAT, deflection rate, cost/case, plus GenAI guardrail metrics like hallucination rate.

## Measuring Success

Offerings should prove themselves on:

**Commercials** (pipeline, win-rate, revenue, margin)

**Delivery** (time-to-value, reuse-rate)

**Customer outcomes** (e.g. –AHT, +conversion)

**Satisfaction** (NPS)

For GenAI, I also add guardrail KPIs — it's not just speed, it's safety.

## Key Principles

**Don't chase hype.** Start with business pain, not shiny tech.

**Move fast but safe:** pilot, learn, adapt.

**Balance build vs buy vs partner.** Build the IP that differentiates you, partner for scale.

At the end of the day, developing offerings is about discipline: painpoints, structure, value proof, and scale. The tech is just the enabler.
