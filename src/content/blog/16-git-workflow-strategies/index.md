# Git Workflow Strategies: GitFlow vs GitHub Flow vs GitLab Flow vs Trunk-based

Choosing the right Git workflow can make or break your development velocity. Here's what you need to know about the four major approaches.

## GitFlow: The Classic Enterprise Approach

GitFlow was king for a reason—it provides structure and formality that enterprises love.

### The Branch Structure

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●────●──── (production releases)
          \              \              \
develop ───●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●──●── (integration)
            \     \        \     \
feature/xyz  ●──●──●        \     \
                 /          \     \
release/v1.1 ───●────●────●──●     \
                          /         \
hotfix/critical ────────●────●───────●
                              \     /
                               ●───●
```

### Key Branches

- **main**: Production-ready code only
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features branch from develop
- **release/**: Prepare releases, branch from develop
- **hotfix/**: Emergency fixes, branch from main

### When GitFlow Works

- **Enterprise environments** with formal release cycles
- **Long-running projects** with scheduled releases
- **Large teams** that need clear ownership boundaries
- **Compliance requirements** that demand traceability

### GitFlow Problems

- **Complex for simple projects** - overkill for most teams
- **Merge conflicts** from long-lived branches
- **Slow feedback loops** - features sit in develop too long
- **Release bottlenecks** - everything waits for the release branch

## GitHub Flow: The Simplicity Champion

GitHub Flow strips away complexity and focuses on continuous deployment.

### The Flow

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●────●──── (always deployable)
          \    \    \    \    \    \
feature1   ●────●    \    \    \    \
               /      \    \    \    \
feature2 ─────●────────●    \    \    \
                      /      \    \    \
feature3 ───────────●─────────●    \    \
                               \    \    \
feature4 ─────────────────────●─────●    \
                                    \     \
feature5 ─────────────────────────●──●────●
                                          /
```

### The Rules

1. **main** is always deployable
2. Create **descriptive branches** for new work
3. **Push early and often** to GitHub
4. Open **pull requests** for discussion
5. **Deploy** immediately after merge
6. **Merge** to main when ready

### When GitHub Flow Works

- **Fast-moving teams** with continuous deployment
- **Web applications** that can deploy frequently
- **Small to medium teams** (2-10 developers)
- **SaaS products** where bugs can be fixed quickly

### GitHub Flow Limitations

- **No release management** - everything goes to production
- **Not suitable for versioned products** (mobile apps, libraries)
- **Requires robust CI/CD** and monitoring
- **Customer-facing bugs** can be problematic

## GitLab Flow: The Practical Middle Ground

GitLab Flow adds environment branches to GitHub Flow for better release control.

### Environment-Based Flow

```
main ────●────●────●────●────●────●──── (source of truth)
          \    \    \    \    \    \
          │     \    \    \    \    \
pre-prod  │      ●────●────●────●────●── (staging environment)
          │           \         \    \
          │            \         \    \
production│             ●─────────●────● (production environment)
          │
feature1   ●────●
               /
feature2 ─────●────────●
                      /
```

### The Strategy

- **main**: Source of truth, all features merge here
- **pre-production**: Mirrors staging environment
- **production**: Mirrors production environment
- **Features**: Branch from main, merge back to main

### Deployment Pipeline

1. Merge feature to **main**
2. Deploy main to **staging**
3. Test in staging environment
4. Promote to **production** when ready

### When GitLab Flow Works

- **Teams needing staging environments**
- **Applications with deployment gates**
- **Gradual rollout strategies**
- **Multiple environment promotion**

## Trunk-based Development: The Speed Demon

Trunk-based development maximizes integration frequency and minimizes merge conflicts.

### Short-lived Branches

```
main ────●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●──── (trunk)
          |\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\
          │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │
         f1 f2f3f4f5f6f7f8f9...      │
          │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │           │
          ●─● ●─●─●─●─●─●─●           │
           \ / / / / / /              │
            ●─●─●─●─●─●               │
                                     │
release/v1.0 ────────────────────────●
```

### Core Principles

- **All developers** commit to main daily
- **Branches live < 1 day** (ideally hours)
- **Feature flags** control feature visibility
- **Continuous integration** catches issues fast
- **Release branches** only for bug fixes

### Implementation Strategy

```typescript
// Feature flags control new features
if (featureFlags.newCheckoutFlow) {
  return <NewCheckoutComponent />;
}
return <LegacyCheckoutComponent />;
```

### When Trunk-based Works

- **High-frequency deployment** teams
- **Mature CI/CD pipelines** with automated testing
- **Feature flag infrastructure** in place
- **Senior teams** comfortable with discipline
- **Products where rollback** is acceptable

### Requirements for Success

- **Robust automated testing** (90%+ code coverage)
- **Feature flag system** for safe deployments
- **Monitoring and observability** for quick problem detection
- **Team discipline** for small, frequent commits

## Choosing Your Strategy

### Team Size Considerations

**Small Teams (2-5)**

- GitHub Flow or Trunk-based
- Simple processes work better
- Less coordination overhead

**Medium Teams (6-15)**

- GitLab Flow or modified GitFlow
- Need some process structure
- Environment promotion helpful

**Large Teams (15+)**

- GitFlow or structured GitLab Flow
- Clear ownership boundaries essential
- Formal release processes valuable

### Release Frequency Considerations

**Continuous Deployment**

- Trunk-based or GitHub Flow
- Deploy multiple times per day
- Feature flags essential

**Weekly/Bi-weekly Releases**

- GitLab Flow
- Environment promotion valuable
- Some release coordination needed

**Monthly/Quarterly Releases**

- GitFlow
- Formal release planning
- Long-term branch management

### Industry Considerations

**SaaS/Web Applications**

- Trunk-based or GitHub Flow
- Fast iteration valuable
- Easy rollback possible

**Mobile Applications**

- GitFlow or GitLab Flow
- App store approval cycles
- Version management critical

**Enterprise Software**

- GitFlow
- Customer deployment cycles
- Formal change management

**Open Source Projects**

- GitHub Flow
- Community contribution friendly
- Review-centric workflow

## Common Anti-patterns

### The "Develop Hell"

```bash
# Feature branches that live for weeks
git log --oneline develop
* 7a8b9c2 Merge feature/huge-refactor (3 weeks old)
* 4d5e6f7 Merge feature/database-migration (2 weeks old)
* 1a2b3c4 Merge feature/ui-overhaul (4 weeks old)
```

**Problem**: Long-lived branches create merge nightmares.
**Solution**: Smaller features, frequent integration.

### The "Release Branch Accumulator"

```bash
# Release branch becomes a dumping ground
git log release/v2.0
* Fix critical bug found in testing
* Add last-minute feature request
* Fix merge conflicts from develop
* Another critical fix
* Emergency UI change
```

**Problem**: Release branches become unstable.
**Solution**: Feature freeze before release branch.

### The "Main Branch Broken"

```bash
# CI pipeline always failing
main branch - ❌ Tests failing (2 days)
develop branch - ❌ Build broken (1 day)
feature/xyz - ✅ All green
```

**Problem**: No one can work on a broken main.
**Solution**: Protect main with required checks.

## Migration Strategies

### From GitFlow to GitHub Flow

1. **Week 1**: Stop creating new release branches
2. **Week 2**: Merge pending features directly to main
3. **Week 3**: Remove develop branch, retrain team
4. **Week 4**: Establish continuous deployment

### From GitHub Flow to Trunk-based

1. **Month 1**: Implement feature flags
2. **Month 2**: Reduce branch lifetime to < 2 days
3. **Month 3**: Aim for daily commits to main
4. **Month 4**: Remove long-lived feature branches

### From GitFlow to GitLab Flow

1. **Week 1**: Create environment branches
2. **Week 2**: Establish promotion pipeline
3. **Week 3**: Remove develop branch
4. **Week 4**: Direct feature merges to main

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure workflow effectiveness:

**Integration Health**

- Mean time between commits to main
- Merge conflict frequency
- Failed merge rate

**Delivery Speed**

- Lead time (commit to production)
- Deployment frequency
- Change failure rate

**Developer Experience**

- Time spent on merge conflicts
- Branch management overhead
- Context switching frequency

## The Bottom Line

**Choose based on your constraints, not trends.**

- **Need formal releases?** → GitFlow
- **Want speed and simplicity?** → GitHub Flow
- **Need environment control?** → GitLab Flow
- **Maximum integration velocity?** → Trunk-based

The best workflow is the one your team can execute consistently. Start simple and evolve as your needs change.

Remember: the workflow serves the team, not the other way around.
