# Technical Sales & Presales 101: The very basics

This article is mainly aimed at developers looking to switch into technical sales. So I cover the very basics of this topic.

## Lead

A lead is just a potential customer. This can be someone that signed up for a demo, someone in your contacts who you think might be interested in your product, someone who signed up for a free trial etc. There are however different types of leads and I will introduce them now. 

To avoid confusion, a lead typically refers to a person. That person of course it usually associated to a company, and that company will hopefully become a customer one day.

### Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)

A lead that meets certain marketing criteria (right job title, company size, industry, engagement with marketing content). Marketing might say: _"This person looks like our ICP (ideal customer profile)"_. This means, that person is a MQL.

### Sales Accepted Lead (SAL)

This is a lead where sales agrees it's worth working on. So the marketing team has a lead and the sales team _"agrees it's a good lead_". The lead then is considered a SAL.

### Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)

This is the stage we desire. This is the stage we want in order to continue with actually trying to make this lead a customer. So what a SQL is, is really just a lead that has shown interest in becoming a customer and marketing and sales agree they're a good fit.

Often, _BANT_ is used to see whether a lead is a good fit. BANT = Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline. A SQL is often also called a _prospect_. SQLs are so important because they are the group of leads that are most likely to be converted into customers.

We generally want to know as much as possible about our leads. This helps to identify why they need our product or service. This allows us for a tailored pitch and tailored language. And so on.

## The Process

What we want is to find many potential customers, also called _generating leads_ and at some point convert them into customers. So we want: lead ➜ SQL ➜ customer. This is the process. Here some more details.

**1. Generating leads:** there are many ways to generate leads and this is a big topic on its own. Some are networking, asking for referrals, or internet marketing.

**2. BANT:** So now that we have leads, we want to see whether they are qualified, so we would invest more time in them. Again: Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline. So we determine if the lead has the financial resources, decision-making authority, genuine requirement for the product or service, and a specific timeframe for purchase. If yes, then we consider this lead a strong candidate for further qualification. This assessment is typically done by sales representatives.

**3. Lead Scoring:** As the next step, we _score our leads_. That is, we assign them numerical values that represent how likely it is to convert them into customers. This can be based on many things, such as company size, engagement level and job title.

**4. Lead Nurturing:** By lead nurturing we mean _taking care of a lead_. The goal is to build trust and spark interest. This means providing info about the product or service and addressing their pain points. This may be achieved through personalised email campaigns, case studies, content marketing, and webinars. Important, we use our lead scoring to decide how much time we invest into lead nurturing for each lead.

**5. Scheduling a Meeting or Call:** Once a lead has shown strong interest in the product or service, we schedule a meeting or a call. Here we will dive deep into the lead's requirements, understand their challenges and pain points, and present tailored solutions.

**6. Closing the Deal:** This is the final step of this process. When the lead shows a strong interest in the service or product and you've had a meeting or multiple already, it might be time for closing the deal. This includes making a deal proposal, which includes a summary of the customer's needs, a detailed explanation of the proposed solution, why and how that's good for the customer, pricing, terms and coditions and more. But it also includes negotiating aspects of the proposal. 

This process is called sales pipeline. If we would outline the same process but write everything from the customer's perspective instead and notice that the amount of leads decreases with every step, it would be called sales funnel. However, these two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.

Note that we also often say _the pipeline_ and mean the above process together with all existing leads. So the _state_ your entire sales cylce is in right now.

## People involved

Let's clarify who is involved in this process.

### Account Executive (AE)

The account executive, also called sales representative or just sales rep, is the person who acts as the primary point of contact and _owns_ a particular lead or potential deal. This means, he is the main face of your company to this lead. He is responsible for building the relationship and understanding the customer's needs.

However, he is not working alone of course.

The entire process can only start if we have leads. The lead generation is typically done by the marketing team (doing ads, social media marketing, online content etc).

Next, we distinguish between _pre sales_ and _post sales_. Not hard to guess, but presales is all the activities and support that occur before a sale closes. That includes customer research, prospecting, discovery (including technical discovery) and more. Post sales is everything after the deal was closed, so for example a good onboarding and general _customer success_.

Just as a note, developers, software architects, designers and so on, are not part of this process. At least not by the standard business lingo. Of course, the developers start working after the deal was closed, but when we say _"post sales"_, we're not talking about that. We're talking about things like customer suport or account management.

Now when we talk about _someone in presales_, often we mean someone with technical expertise. That is often a _solution engineer_ or a _solution architect_ and their role typically is to help with technical discovery, answer technical questions that might come up (AEs don't know the answer normally), help architect and design the proposed solution and take part in the presentation of it, in the pitch.

## Not everyone is a Prospect

I will not dive deep here, but it's important to understand that not every lead is a prospect. It's **very important** to narrow down in the sales cycle. There is a reason we have different terms (Lead, MQL, SQL). If you don't narrow it down and do good lead scoring, you will waste resources massively. Don't treat everyone like SQL.

### Customer-centric Approach

Some say that, in presales, you should never talk more than the customer. It's about understanding the lead and his pain points.

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**: This is sometimes seen as the holy grail metric. A $10K monthly commitment represents $120K ARR.

**Total Contract Value (TCV) vs Annual Contract Value (ACV)**: TCV is the total value over the contract lifetime; ACV is the annual value. Understanding both helps you position multi-year deals effectively.

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: How much it costs to acquire a customer. Your efficiency in moving deals through technical qualification directly impacts CAC.

**Land and Expand**: Start with a smaller initial implementation, prove value, then expand usage across the organization. This is particularly relevant for selling SaaS where you might start with one application and grow to enterprise-wide adoption.

**Champion vs Economic Buyer**: Your champion is the technical person who advocates for your solution internally. The economic buyer is the person who can actually approve the budget. These are often different people, and you need strategies for both.

**Compelling Event**: The business or technical driver that creates urgency. Maybe they're launching a new product, facing compliance deadlines, or their current system is at breaking point. No compelling event usually means no urgency to buy.

**MEDDIC**: A qualification framework - Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion. This framework is very common, however some swear one it while others say it's just a fancy term for management.

**Opportunity**: A potential deal that's in progress. It's tracked in CRM systems like Salesforce or HubSpot.

**SOW (Statement of Work)**: A detailed breakdown of the work you'll deliver, often part of the contract. More technical and delivery-focused than a general proposal.

**SME (Subject Matter Expert)**: A specialist who provides deep technical or industry knowledge during presales. For example, a cloud architect, data scientist, or healthcare consultant.

**RFP / RFI**: RFP = Request for Proposal, where the client formally asks vendors to submit detailed bids. RFI = Request for Information, which is an earlier stage where the client asks for general info.

**Deal / Contract**: Deal is slang for a signed agreement for services. Contract is the legal agreement that includes terms, payment schedule, SOW, etc.

**Close / Win**: Close the deal means get the contract signed. Win the deal means beat competitors and land the engagement.

**Churn**: Customers leaving. Especially important for SaaS and account managers.
