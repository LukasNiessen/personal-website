# Polling vs Long Polling vs SSE vs WebSockets: Real-Time Data Strategies

Your app needs real-time updates. Stock prices, chat messages, live scores, notification counts. How do you get data from server to client instantly?

You have four main options. Each has tradeoffs.

## 1. Polling (Regular/Short Polling)

The simplest approach. Client asks server for updates on a regular schedule.

```javascript
// Check for updates every 5 seconds
setInterval(() => {
  fetch('/api/messages')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => updateUI(data));
}, 5000);
```

**How it works:**

1. Client makes HTTP request
2. Server responds immediately with current data
3. Connection closes
4. Wait X seconds, repeat

**Pros:**

- Simple to implement
- Works with any HTTP setup
- Easy to debug and monitor
- Stateless - works with load balancers

**Cons:**

- Wasted requests when nothing changes
- Delayed updates (up to polling interval)
- Increased server load and bandwidth usage
- Not truly real-time

**When to use:** Infrequent updates, simple requirements, when other methods aren't feasible.

## 2. Long Polling

More sophisticated polling. Client asks for updates and server waits to respond until there's new data.

```javascript
async function longPoll() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/messages/poll');
    const data = await response.json();
    updateUI(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Polling error:', error);
  } finally {
    // Immediately start next poll
    setTimeout(longPoll, 1000); // Small delay to prevent tight loops
  }
}

longPoll();
```

**How it works:**

1. Client makes HTTP request
2. Server holds connection open (30-60 seconds typically)
3. When new data arrives OR timeout occurs, server responds
4. Connection closes
5. Client immediately starts new request

**Pros:**

- Near real-time updates
- Fewer wasted requests than regular polling
- Works with existing HTTP infrastructure
- Fallback compatibility

**Cons:**

- Ties up server connections (resource intensive)
- Complex timeout handling
- Can be tricky with proxies and firewalls
- Still request overhead

**When to use:** Moderate real-time needs, when WebSockets aren't available, behind corporate firewalls.

## 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Server pushes data to client over a persistent HTTP connection.

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/messages/stream');

eventSource.onmessage = function (event) {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  updateUI(data);
};

eventSource.onerror = function (event) {
  console.error('SSE error:', event);
};
```

**Server side (Node.js example):**

```javascript
app.get('/api/messages/stream', (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    Connection: 'keep-alive',
  });

  // Send data
  const sendUpdate = (data) => {
    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`);
  };

  // Subscribe to updates and send them
  messageService.onUpdate(sendUpdate);
});
```

**How it works:**

1. Client opens persistent HTTP connection
2. Server sends data as it becomes available
3. Connection stays open indefinitely
4. Built-in reconnection on connection loss

**Pros:**

- True real-time, server-initiated updates
- Automatic reconnection
- Simple client-side API
- Works over standard HTTP
- Built-in event types and IDs

**Cons:**

- One-way communication only (server → client)
- Limited browser connection pool (6 per domain)
- Can be blocked by some corporate firewalls
- No binary data support

**When to use:** Real-time dashboards, live feeds, notifications, when you only need server-to-client communication.

## 4. WebSockets

Full bidirectional communication channel.

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected');
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: 'subscribe', channel: 'messages' }));
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  updateUI(data);
};

socket.onclose = () => {
  console.log('Disconnected');
  // Implement reconnection logic
};
```

**How it works:**

1. HTTP upgrade handshake establishes WebSocket connection
2. Persistent TCP connection maintained
3. Both client and server can send messages anytime
4. Very low overhead per message

**Pros:**

- True real-time, bidirectional communication
- Very low latency
- Minimal overhead per message
- Binary data support
- Custom protocols possible

**Cons:**

- More complex to implement correctly
- Doesn't work with standard HTTP caching/proxies
- Stateful connections complicate load balancing
- Manual reconnection handling required
- Can be blocked by corporate firewalls

**When to use:** Interactive applications, gaming, collaborative editing, trading platforms, chat applications.

## Quick Comparison

| Method           | Latency  | Complexity | Bandwidth | Browser Support | Bidirectional |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| **Polling**      | High     | Low        | High      | Universal       | No            |
| **Long Polling** | Medium   | Medium     | Medium    | Universal       | No            |
| **SSE**          | Low      | Low        | Low       | Modern          | No            |
| **WebSockets**   | Very Low | High       | Very Low  | Modern          | Yes           |

## Choosing the Right Approach

**Use Polling when:**

- Updates are infrequent (every few minutes)
- Simple requirements
- Maximum compatibility needed

**Use Long Polling when:**

- Need better responsiveness than polling
- WebSockets blocked by infrastructure
- Moderate real-time requirements

**Use SSE when:**

- Need real-time server-to-client updates
- Don't need client-to-server real-time messaging
- Building dashboards, feeds, notifications

**Use WebSockets when:**

- Need true bidirectional real-time communication
- Building interactive applications
- Latency is critical
- Willing to handle complexity

## Implementation Considerations

### Fallback Strategy

Many applications use progressive enhancement:

```javascript
// Try WebSocket first, fallback to SSE, then long polling
if (window.WebSocket) {
  useWebSocket();
} else if (window.EventSource) {
  useSSE();
} else {
  useLongPolling();
}
```

### Connection Management

All persistent connections need handling for:

- Reconnection on network issues
- Heartbeat/keepalive messages
- Graceful degradation
- Connection pooling limits

### Scaling Considerations

- **Polling:** Scales well with stateless servers
- **Long Polling:** Limited by concurrent connection capacity
- **SSE:** Limited by concurrent connections
- **WebSockets:** Requires sticky sessions or message broadcasting

## Real-World Examples

**Polling:** Weather widgets, system dashboards with infrequent updates

**Long Polling:** Facebook chat (historically), some REST APIs with real-time needs

**SSE:** Live sports scores, stock tickers, system monitoring dashboards

**WebSockets:** Slack/Discord chat, collaborative editors (Google Docs), online games, trading platforms

## Bottom Line

Start simple and evolve based on needs:

1. **Begin with polling** if updates are infrequent
2. **Move to SSE** when you need server-initiated real-time updates
3. **Upgrade to WebSockets** when you need bidirectional real-time communication
4. **Always plan for fallbacks** and connection management

The "best" choice depends on your specific requirements for latency, complexity, infrastructure, and user experience. Don't over-engineer—many applications work perfectly fine with simple polling.
