# E-commerce Platform Technical Deep Dive

## WooCommerce

### Technical Architecture
**Core Technology:**
- Built on WordPress (PHP/MySQL)
- REST API (WP REST API + WooCommerce REST API)
- GraphQL support via WPGraphQL plugin
- Hook and filter system for customization

**API Capabilities:**
- REST API v3 (primary): `/wp-json/wc/v3/`
- Endpoints for products, orders, customers, coupons, reports
- Webhook support for real-time data sync
- OAuth 1.0a or API key authentication
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests per hour (configurable)

### Headless Implementation
**Approach:**
- Decouple frontend using REST API or GraphQL
- Keep WordPress admin as content management backend
- Popular headless frameworks: Next.js, Gatsby, Nuxt.js

**Technical Setup:**
```
Frontend (React/Vue/Angular) ↔ WooCommerce REST API ↔ WordPress Backend
```

### Composable Architecture
**Modularity:**
- Plugin-based architecture (40,000+ plugins)
- Microservices possible via API-first approach
- Action/filter hooks for custom business logic
- Third-party service integration via plugins

### ERP/CRM Integration

**Microsoft Dynamics 365:**
- **Integration Methods:**
  - Direct API integration using D365 Web API
  - Middleware solutions (Zapier, Microsoft Power Platform)
  - Custom connectors using D365 Common Data Service
- **Data Sync:** Products, inventory, customers, orders
- **Real-time sync** via webhooks + Microsoft Flow

**Oracle ERP:**
- **Integration Approaches:**
  - Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC)
  - REST API connections to Oracle Fusion Cloud
  - Custom middleware using Oracle APEX
- **Sync Capabilities:** Financial data, inventory, customer master data

**PIM Integration:**
- Akeneo PIM via REST API connector
- Salsify integration through CSV/API imports
- Pimcore connection using REST endpoints

**CMS Integration:**
- Native WordPress CMS capabilities
- Headless CMS options: Contentful, Strapi via API
- Advanced Custom Fields for product content

### Most Common Integration Approach
In practice, most WooCommerce implementations follow a hybrid approach where the platform remains fully coupled for smaller businesses, but larger enterprises typically implement a middleware layer using tools like Zapier or custom PHP scripts that run scheduled jobs. The most prevalent pattern involves keeping WooCommerce as the primary e-commerce engine while using REST API connections to sync data with external systems on a scheduled basis rather than real-time integration. For ERP connections, businesses commonly use CSV-based imports/exports combined with webhook notifications for critical updates like inventory changes. This approach balances cost-effectiveness with functionality, allowing businesses to start simple and add complexity as they scale.

## Shopify

### Technical Architecture
**Core Technology:**
- Ruby on Rails backend (Shopify-managed)
- Liquid templating engine

- **Storefront API:** GraphQL for custom frontends
- **REST Admin API:** 40+ resource endpoints
- **Webhooks:** Real-time event notifications
- **Rate Limits:** 2 requests/second (REST), complex cost-based system (GraphQL)

### Headless Implementation
**Shopify Hydrogen Framework:**
- React-based framework optimized for Shopify
- Server-side rendering with Oxygen hosting
- Built-in Shopify integrations

**Custom Headless:**
```
Custom Frontend ↔ Storefront API (GraphQL) ↔ Shopify Backend
Admin Interface ↔ Admin API (GraphQL) ↔ Shopify Core
```

**Technical Features:**
- Multipass for SSO integration
- Shopify Scripts for custom checkout logic
- Shopify Functions for backend customization

### Composable Architecture
**App Ecosystem:**
- 8,000+ apps in Shopify App Store
- Private apps for custom integrations
- Shopify CLI for development workflows
- App Bridge for embedded app experiences

**Microservices Support:**
- Shopify Functions (serverless backend logic)
- External API integrations via apps
- Event-driven architecture with webhooks

### ERP/CRM Integration

**Microsoft Dynamics 365:**
- **Certified Apps:** 
  - Dynamics 365 Business Central connector
  - CRM integration apps in Shopify App Store
- **Integration Points:**
  - Customer data synchronization
  - Inventory management
  - Financial reporting integration
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Power Platform connectors
  - Azure Logic Apps for workflow automation

**Oracle ERP:**
- **Integration Methods:**
  - Oracle Integration Cloud adapters
  - Custom REST API connectors
  - Third-party middleware (Celigo, Boomi)
- **Data Flow:**
  - Real-time inventory sync
  - Order-to-cash process integration
  - Financial data consolidation

**PIM Integration:**
- **Akeneo:** Direct connector available
- **Salsify:** Native Shopify integration

- **InRiver:** Certified Shopify connector

**CMS Integration:**
- **Contentful:** Official Shopify app
- **Sanity:** Real-time content sync
- **Strapi:** Custom API integration
- **WordPress:** Headless content delivery

### Most Common Integration Approach
The majority of Shopify merchants leverage the app ecosystem rather than building custom integrations from scratch. For ERP connections, businesses typically install pre-built connector apps from the Shopify App Store, with the Dynamics 365 Business Central connector and various Oracle NetSuite apps being the most popular choices. These apps handle the complexity of API authentication, data mapping, and error handling automatically. For larger enterprises, the pattern involves using Shopify Plus with a combination of certified apps and Shopify Flow for automation, supplemented by custom scripts when needed. Most implementations avoid fully headless setups initially, instead opting for theme customizations and gradual adoption of the Storefront API for specific features like mobile apps or custom checkout experiences.

### Most Common Integration Approach
Salesforce Commerce Cloud implementations almost universally start with the native Salesforce ecosystem integration, leveraging the shared customer data model across Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. This provides immediate value through unified customer profiles and automated lead-to-revenue processes. For external ERP systems, the most common pattern involves using MuleSoft Anypoint Platform as the integration layer, particularly for Oracle ERP connections where pre-built connectors handle the heavy lifting of data transformation and synchronization. Enterprises typically implement a hub-and-spoke model with Salesforce as the customer data hub, while ERP systems remain the source of truth for product and financial data. Most organizations avoid fully headless implementations initially, instead using the standard SFRA templates with customizations, gradually adopting PWA Kit components for mobile-first experiences as their digital maturity increases.

## Integration Best Practices

### General Principles
1. **API-First Design:** Prioritize REST/GraphQL APIs for flexibility
2. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use webhooks for real-time synchronization
3. **Data Governance:** Establish clear data ownership and flow patterns
4. **Security:** Implement OAuth 2.0, API keys, and rate limiting
5. **Monitoring:** Set up API monitoring and error handling

### Common Integration Patterns
- **Master Data Management (MDM):** Central hub for customer/product data
- **Event Sourcing:** Track all changes for audit and replay capabilities
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate read/write operations
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Handle API failures gracefully
