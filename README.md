# Personal Blog

This is my personal homepage and blog. I built this site with Astro, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and a dash of React for the interactive bits. The website is in **beta**.

Feel free to use it however you like, privately or commercially.

## üöÄ Built For Performance and SEO

Everything is static.

- Pages weigh in under 100kb
- Renders in about 40ms locally

## üõ†Ô∏è Dev Commands

Got the code? Here's how to play with it:

| Command           | What It Does                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `npm i`           | Gets all the goodies installed             |
| `npm run dev`     | Fires up local dev at `localhost:4321`     |
| `npm run build`   | Creates production-ready site in `./dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Checks out your build before it goes live  |

## Architecture

I used Astro and React. The site therefore consists of static files. They are hosted on AWS S3. Additionally, I use CloudFront and Route 53.

## Contributing

You are very welcome to contribute! I use GitHub Flow, so if you want to contribute, just create a feature/fix branch and create a PR when ready. As soon as it's merged, it will be automatically deployed.

Note that you can reuse this project however you like, including creating your own blog from it by just replacing texts and images. üòä

## Todo

- Proper CI, that is especially linting
